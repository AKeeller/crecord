.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcrecord\fR (camera-record) is an utility meant to record video streams from security IP cameras. However, you can use it to record any kind of video stream from the web.
.br
\fBcrecord\fR has four verbs: \fIrecord\fR, \fIall\fR, \fIdelete\fR, \fIuninstall\fR. We are going to discuss each of them in this section; you can find some examples below.
.SS record
\fIrecord\fR is the main verb. It's purpose is to record a video stream from a given ip address or url. It supports many options and you can find them all later in this document.
.SS all
\fIall\fR does not require any argument. It automatically reads all the settings he needs and start to record simultaneously from different cameras. To correctly configure \fIall\fR, give a look to \fI/etc/crecord.config\fR.
.SS delete
Use this if you want to delete you recordings. I suggest to use \fIdelete\fR in crontab.
.SS uninstall
Use this verb to completely uninstall \fBcrecord\fR. Note that this won't delete your recordings.
